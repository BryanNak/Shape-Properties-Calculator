# Shape-Properties-Calculator
A simple shape properties calculator for 7 shapes that I developed for ICS 212.

This is a simple shape properties calculator for seven 2D and 3D geometrical shapes that I created in C++. The program will display a list from 0-6 with each number associated with a shape and give the user the choice to choose a shape. The user can input 7 otherwise to quit the program. The program takes an integer from 1 to 7 from the user, asks for additional information about the shape, and calculates and prints basic properties of the shape that the user selected.   

Here is an example of obtaining some properties of a cube:

```
user:~$ ./program
Select an object from the menu (enter 7 to quit).
        0. Circle
        1. Sphere
        2. Cylinder
        3. Square
        4. Cube
        5. Triangle
        6. Tetrahedron
4
Enter the Cube's side: 10
The Cube's surface area = 600
The Cube's volume = 1000
```
